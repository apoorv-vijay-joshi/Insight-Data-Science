I ran the python script on my machine which has Python 3.4.3 version. The shell script should run on all the operating systems, but my machine has OSX (MAC) installed on it which runs it perfectly.
Compile the shell script 'run.sh' initially with the command 'cmod u+x run.sh'.
Have the tweets text file 'tweets.txt' in the 'tweets_input' directory before executing the program.
There is just one python script to be executed for both the purposes of listing the unique words in the text file and its count and the median of the number of unique words in the text file.
